# Sam Beckham's Blog

Just your standard Jekyll blog.

## Running locally
```
npm install
gem install jekyll scss-lint
npm start
```

## Running on a server
Assuming You have Node, npm and ruby already installed:
There's some weirdness with versions that I need to iron out though.

```
npm install
gem install jekyll scss-lint
npm run build
```

Then point your server to the `web` directory.
