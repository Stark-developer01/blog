I am Sam. I'm a front-end developer from the top right corner of England. I do not like green eggs and ham.

Playing about with the web is my passion and something I do for fun on here, and proffessionally at [Drummond Central](http://www.drummondcentral.co.uk). I also do the occasional bit of freelance work if the project's right. Got something interesting that needs building? [Get in touch](mailto:sam@beckham.io).
