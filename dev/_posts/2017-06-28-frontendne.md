Last week I attended the Web Community Leaders Summit (UK/IE) at the Google headquarters in London.

I was representing [Frontend NE](https://frontendne.co.uk) and was amongst organisers of various meet ups in the UK and Ireland. We talked about our meet ups, the issues we faced, and how we overcame those issues. It was a day of sharing and a great relief to hear that most of them had the same woes we have in running a meet up. The day has inspired me to write this post. A post about how Frontend NE began, where it ended up, and where we plan to take it next. With a few stories of our failures and successes along the way.

## The beginning
An [Englishman](https://twitter.com/samdbeckham), an [Irishman](https://twitter.com/mynameiscolin), and a [Scotsman](https://twitter.com/tempertemper) walked into a barâ€¦

We had a long discussion about meet ups, and the lack thereof in Newcastle. There were a few that had come and gone, but we wanted better. We wanted a consistent meet up for Front end developers that put on some good talks and got a few people talking afterwards. Several beers and a Brew dog Deli platter later, we decided we would make our own.

Later that night I registered a mail chimp account and set up a newsletter signup on a holding page. And tweeted it out so there was no going back.

The first thing we did after that was set up a Slack channel. Not a public one, just one for the three of us to bounce our ideas around and see what stuck. Right from the start we knew consistency was key. The original plan was to have it bi-monthly, but that got confusing. Mainly because bi-monthly both means twice a month and once every two months. English can be a strange language. We changed it to monthly and checked [tech diary](#) for clashes with other meet ups. Finally, we settled on the first Thursday of every month. It's right after pay day, it's easy to remember and it falls on Star Wars day once every few years.

Armed with our new date, we booked a venue. [Campus North](#) were known for hosting a lot of meet ups in the past so we approached them first. They allowed us to use their back room which held 30 people comfortably and 50 people before we started breaking fire regulations. We set a date for the first Thursday of the following month, April 2nd 2015.

Now that we had a date set and about 40 people on our (heavily promoted) mailing list, it was time to find a speaker. We set up a type form survey as a make-shift call for speakers and sent it out to our mailing list, along with the date of our first event. We pestered anyone and everyone that would listen and put links to the CFP anywhere that would let us. Then we sat back and waited for the proposals to come in. We got a lot of submissions. A lot of them were spam, some of them were nonsense, but the majority of them were all potential candidates for the meet up. From that pool of proposals, we created a backlog and booked people in for the first two meet ups.

Somewhere along the way (I forget the chronology of all this) we found some sponsors. As with the rest of this process, we leaned heavily on our friends to help us out. [Jamie Hurst](#) agreed to pick up the pizza tab, whilst [Peacock Carter](#) brought along some drinks.

We were surprised as to how quickly we'd gotten the essentials done. We had a date, a venue, a website, and two speakers. Now we could get into promoting the event. We came up with a proper logo, ordered stickers, extended the holding page to show the event information, and set up an account with [tito](http://ti.to) so we could sell tickets for the event. Every opportunity we got to talk about the event, we seized. Partly to promote it, but mainly because we were incredibly excited to be finally doing it.

## The first event

We announced that we would be releasing (free) tickets a week before our first event. There were 30 tickets since this is what the room we hired could handle. We hoped for 20 people, expected 15m and would have been happy with 10. The tickets were released at 1:00pm on the 26th of March. When we checked back 2 hours later, they were all gone. Every, single, one. 30 people may not seem like a lot, but given the state of local meet ups at the time, this was unheard of. People were tweeting us demanding more tickets get released. This was the first time we realised we were on to something. People wanted this almost as much as we did.

After speaking to the venue about the fire regulations, we released another 20 tickets the following day at 1pm. By 2pm, they had all gone again.

The event went off without a hitch, we had two great talks from [Robb Walker]() and [Martin Underhill]() (the Scottish member of our trio). The free pizzas and beers went down as well as expected and there was a great turnout in the pub next door after the event.

## To be continued
In writing this post I went back through my archived notebooks (yes, I archive my notebooks) and realised just how much we put into starting this thing up. None of it seemed like hard work at the time because we all genuinely loved what we were doing.

There's still a lot more of this story to tell. The addition of paying sponsors, the ever evolving video process, the loss of our venue, and much more. But I'll follow up on all of that in another post. There's a lot to write and I want to try out Medium's new series feature. Till next time!
