title: Running a Conference
background: '#4CAF7E'

Running a conference is 24% blood 62% sweat, 15% tears, and a pinch of being so overworked you forget how to count to 100. But it's worth it.

We recently wrapped on [Frontend NE: The conference 2018](https://2018.frontendne.co.uk), and I'm happy to say it went well. There were a few hiccups, but we got away with them. [Speakers](https://twitter.com/NikkitaFTW/status/982204431369318400), [sponsors](https://twitter.com/bytemark/status/983351836638924804), and [attendees](https://twitter.com/wtomcarter/status/982017051429687296) alike have said nothing but positive things, so we did something right.

After running one successful conference I feel I'm totally qualified to write the definitive list on conference organisation… Just kidding. I still have a lot to learn, but here's what I've learned so far.

## It's just business
A conference is a business, so run it like one. I'm not saying you have to wear a suit and explain to people [what it is that you do here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StIcRH_e6zQ). But you do need to do some basic things to make sure you're covered. Register your business, get an accountant, and have a separate bank account. You're going to be dealing with a lot of money from a lot of sources. Self-funding it and working out the tax later is not going to cut it.

As soon as we decided to go ahead with the conference, we hired an accountant and started a Limited Company. We used that to open a  bank account and hooked up our accounting software. Getting this all set up ahead of time was crucial. We could now pay people and take in sponsorship with relative ease.

## Get some sponsors
You don't **have** to do this, but it helps. We worked out how much money we needed to run an MVC (minimum viable conference) for 50 people. Then split that cost amongst 6 sponsorship packages. That way, if everything went terribly and barely anyone bought a ticket, we were still covered. This MVC consisted of, venue hire, A/V hire and speaker costs. Nothing more.

## Pay your speakers
I can't believe I have to write this. But unfortunately, it seems a lot of conferences don't get this. Your speakers are the main reason people are attending your conference, so pay them. Pay for their travel, pay for their accommodation, and pay for their time.

At Frontend NE, we paid all our speakers the same amount. We offered them travel from their door to ours, accommodation (close to the venue), and a speaking fee of £1,000. We offered every speaker—no matter the calibre—the exact same package. With the option to donate some or their fee to a diversity fund.

## Have a diversity/student fund
A diversity fund pays for tickets, travel, and accommodation for underrepresented people. This meant that anyone could attend the conference. Regardless of their race, religion, gender, education level, or financial status. We borrowed this concept from Remy Sharp's [FFconf](https://2017.ffconf.org/scholarship) which explains it much better than I could.

Through our diversity fund, we managed to pay for several people  to attend our conference. Not only did this help them, it helped make our conference a lot more diverse and welcoming.  If you do one of these yourself, be sure not to label them, or give them "special" tickets. This could send the wrong message.

## Don't have special tickets
Early bird, late bird, student bird, big bird, it's all too much. I understand the reasoning behind these ticketing systems, but they're not for me. As an attendee I feel undue pressure at the checkout. As an organiser, I couldn't handle the cashflow problems it introduces. We pay the same per-head cost for each person that attends the conference. So with one ticket we know exactly how many we need to sell to break even.

There may be some divided opinions on this one. But remember, everyone has their opinions and this one is mine. Feel free to ignore it, but it saved us a lot of headaches.

## Budget
Budgeting and being frugal are often confused, but are not the same thing. I'm not saying you should cut corners and spend money only when necessary. Just be aware of what you're spending and make sure you account for everything. The last thing you want is to be out of pocket at the end of it all. 

I'm pretty terrible at budgeting. I leave that to my partner, both in life and in business (not the same person). Colin handled the budgeting for the conference. He was the man to ask if you needed to know how much we could spend on things. This budget saved our skin a few times, and helped a lot when negotiating prices.

## No man is an island
That is to say, don't do this alone. Frontend NE is a three-man operation and we have other people that help out with various things all the time. There's too much work for one person to do alone. We've been running a successful meet up together for three years now. Each of us has a slightly different skill-set that compliments each other's. We all have full time jobs, and some of us have families too. So having other people you can rely on is crucial.

Huge thank you to [Colin](https://twitter.com/htmlandbacon) and [Martin](https://twitter.com/tempertemper) for doing this with me and putting up with my bullshit. You're the best.

## Ask for help
We had the benefit of having a meet up behind us. This meant we knew a lot of people we could ask to come and speak, we had an audience to sell to, and we'd already looked at countless venues, caterers, and vendors. But conferences and meet ups are not the same. So we asked for help. We got great advice from other conference organisers up and down the country. We asked them to tell us about the good, the bad, and the ugly parts of running a conference. We asked them about what worked for them, what didn't, and what they'd do different next time. Then we asked them to try and talk us out of it. Thankfully they couldn't.

## Make a run-sheet
You spend a lot of time planning everything out for the conference, but on the day you're going to forget something. To combat this, we made a run sheet. Everyone had their own tasks to be completed at certain times. No only did this help us in knowing what we had to do, it helped us know what othe other organisers were doing. This way, everything that needed to be done got done, and no one did anything that someone else had already done.

## Have fun
In an almost contradictory twist to my initial point, don't treat this like a job. We don't rely on the conference to put food on our tables. We don't take any money from it at all. We do it because we love it. This means we can make decisions based on what we'd like to see ourselves, and not what would make us money. We ran the conference in a brewery, hired out a bowling alley, and rented golf carts. Not because they would sell tickets, but because we could afford them and they were fun.

## Thank you

I've no-doubt missed off a lot of things in this post. It's been a very hectic year and a lot of work has been put in by a lot of people.

So, who's up for a sequel?
