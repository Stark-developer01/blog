title: Funding Your Meetup

Like it or not, your meet up can't run on enthusiasm alone. You need funding in one form or another to keep yourself afloat. Luckily, this is not as hard as it sounds.

In a previous post, [starting a meetup](), I went through the early stages of Frontend NE. We got through our first event with a little help from our friends. But we knew that in order to progress, we needed bigger and better sponsorship.

## The early stages of Sponsorship

In the beginning we had two sponsorship options, the pizza, and the beer. The venue (and soft drinks) was provided to us for free. Whilst this worked well, we were having to pay for all the little extras out of our own pockets. Stickers, web hosting, SAAS subscriptions; they were all small but they added up. We needed a more general, cash based, sponsor.

This opportunity fell right into our laps when a local agency contacted us asking if we could promote their current vacancy. We told them we would, but for a price. We had our eye on some custom printed notebooks to give away and thought it would be the perfect opportunity to get the sponsor to pay for them. We asked for Â£50 and they jumped at it. In hindsight we could have gotten a lot more.

- the loss of a venue (byte mark to the rescue)
- Our new sponsorship system

## Closing
We've learned a lot from getting it right, and even more from getting it wrong. Here are some tips:

1. **Get the right sponsors** Consider whether your sponsors are a good fit for your event. It's a partnership and you both need to benefit from it. It's okay to decline or terminate a sponsorship offer if it's not working. 
2. **Get them in for the long-haul** Consider block-booking your sponsors. This way you're not wasting time looking for a new sponsor each month. Get one sponsor tied down for 6 months or a year.
3. **Don't be afraid** Companies want to sponsor good events, don't be afraid to approach them and ask them if they want to sponsor. If you ask kindly and professionally, you may be surprised at what you can get. Worst case, all you wasted was the time it took to write an email.
