This isn't a charity post. I'm not asking you to buy a massive Turkey for tiny Tim and his family. I'm talking about giving back to our community.

Any developer worth their salt has used an open source project or two before. Whether it's running your tasks with [gulp](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp) (or [grunt](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt)); testing your ideas on [JS Bin](https://github.com/jsbin/jsbin), or even using [jQuery](https://github.com/jquery/jquery). Most of us rely on them every day to help us do our jobs more effectively, efficiently, and easily. All of which comes completely free of charge.

This December, developers from all over the world are giving back to open source projects. With [24 pull requests](http://24pullrequests.com), it's easy to get involved. Log in with your github account, enter your language preferences, and you're away. They'll send you an email every day in December with suggestions for projects and issues that you can help with. It can be something as involved as adding a new feature to a project; or as small as fixing a typo in the documentation. It's up to you how involved you get, but every little helps.

Helping maintain open source projects not only helps the community grow, but can improve your skills as a developer. You can learn a lot from working on open source projects. And it looks fantastic on a CV as well.

So get yourself over to [24 pull requests](http://24pullrequests.com) and give a little back this Christmas. I'll [see you there](http://24pullrequests.com/users/samdbeckham).
