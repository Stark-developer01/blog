Super Clever Stuff is a content storage platform with a built-in RESTful API.
We built a simple CMS to sit on top of the service and allow users to easily edit their content.

Super Clever Stuff is a fantastic way of delivering content.
Becaus it's an API at heart, you can easily deliver the same content to multiple websites or apps.
This allows you to think about the content first and deliver a ruly responsive solution no matter what the medium.

Because Super Clever Stuff is just an API; it aint pretty.
The Super Clever Stuff CMS uses the read/write capabilities of the API, to give you a more user-friendly way to edit your content.

The CMS itself is a Laravel app.
We created a Jekyll-based pattern library to seperate the style and the data.
This allows us to look at each individual component separately, then piece them together as we need them.
It's as simple as copying the markup from the pattern library, importing the styles, and hooking in the dynamic content.

The designs for this site were done in the browser (once we had the basic styles down).
Designing in this way made it quicker to create new elements and easier to tweak existing ones.
It also meant we had all our design iterations in version control, which made comparing designs effortless.
