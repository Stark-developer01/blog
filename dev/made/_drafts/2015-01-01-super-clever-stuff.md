Super Clever Stuff is a content storage platform with a built-in RESTful API.
We built a simple CMS to sit on top of the service and allow users to edit their content in a more user-friendly manner.

Super Clever Stuff is a fantastic way of delivering content.
Because it's an API at heart, you can deliver the same content to multiple websites or apps.
This allows you to think about the content first and deliver a truly responsive solution, no matter what the medium.

Because Super Clever Stuff is an API; it isn't pretty.
The Super Clever Stuff CMS uses the read/write capabilities of the API, to give you a more user-friendly way to edit your content.

The CMS itself is a Laravel app.
We created a Jekyll-based pattern library to separate the style and the data.
This allows us to design and test each component individually.
When they're finished, we pull them into the app; using each component when it's needed.
Just copy the markup from the pattern library, import the styles and hook in the dynamic content.

We created the designs for this site in the browser (once we had the basic styles down).
Designing in this way made it quicker to create new elements and easier to tweak existing ones.
It also meant we had all our design iterations in version control, which made comparing them effortless.
