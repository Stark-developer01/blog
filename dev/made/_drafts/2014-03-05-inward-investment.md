Following from the success of Geordieland, we created it's big brother.
Built in Angular, this app is a lot more grown-up.

When NGI approached us again to build another interactive map, we knew what we had to do.
Had I known about Angular before building Geordieland, it would have been a perfect fit.
This project was our chance to go back and do it, even better than before.
Whilst Geordieland was a great success, we felt it could be improved.

Using Angular routing, we could now point users to a specific sections of the map with a standard http link.
This meant we could link to places such as [local universities](http://map.investnewcastlegateshead.com/map-2/sector-12/venue-791), development zones,  or [Travel links](http://map.investnewcastlegateshead.com/map-2/sector-11/venue-803).

We also introduced three new (smaller) maps to the app.
Again, these were hand-drawn by our designer, Laura.
She put a lot of hours into these maps, and it really shows.

On top of all this, the app is lightening fast.
Angular made caching the API requests a breeze, so you only had to load items once.
