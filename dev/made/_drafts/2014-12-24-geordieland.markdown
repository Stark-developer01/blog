Geordieland was an ambitious task, put to Drummond Central by the Newcastle Gateshead Initiative.
We wanted to take the interactive city map and push it a bit further.

Using the locations of Tweets sent down the Twitter firehose, we plotted them on a hand-drawn map of the city.
This allowed users to see what was happening, and where, in real time.

On top of this, you could get information about key areas of the city.
Shopping hot-spots, places to eat, things to do, etc.
All the data came from Twitter and the pre-existing [Newcastle Gateshead](http://www.newcastlegateshead.com/) website.

It was a great success for the initiative.
Unfortunately, as these things tend to do, it has fallen into a state of dis-repair.
You can still visit it, however, at [geordielandmap.com](http://geordielandmap.com).
If you're in the area, turn your location on and send out a Tweet.
