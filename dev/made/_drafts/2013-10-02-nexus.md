Nexus is the main travel agency for Tyne and Wear.
They have an extensive network of bus, rail and ferry services.
As well as a modern light rail system, known as the Metro.

Drummond Central were tasked with the re-development of their wesite in 2013.
It had to be fast, responsive and mobile friendly as a lot of users would be accessing the site via mobile devices.

Built on the Drupal CMS, this site serves thousands of commuters, daily.
It provides information such as, timetables, service status and modernisation information.
If you want to know anything about travel in the Tyne and Wear area, this is the place to go.

A lot of work went into improving the usability of the timetables.
This proved difficult due to the sporadic nature of the Metro system.
Simpler timetables—like the ferry (below)—were improved dramatically.
