The Photographic Museum of Humanity is a social network for Photographers, and a whole lot more…

When I started at [No Divide](http://nodividestudio.com), my first project was the Photographic Museum of Humanity (PMH).
PMH is a hub for photographers and editors to come together; it's a place for Photographers to showcase their work to both their peers and their potential clients.
You can create [stories](https://phmuseum.com/maxcabello/story/chungui-journey-to-the-center-of-oblivion-9636c1e68d), post [photos](https://phmuseum.com/go85/activity/10937), send private messages, sell your work, and much more.

One of the central features of the site is the—algoila powered—search.
The inline search utilises Algolia's speed to give real-time results; whilst the Advanced search uses Algolia's faceting to refine these results.

The app is built in Laravel with the majority of the front end created with [Vue.js](http://vuejs.org).
